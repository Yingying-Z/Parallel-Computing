# Parallel-Computing
This is a quick tutorial on how to implement parallel computation on the Gizmo cluster, 
maintained by Scientific Computing at FHCRC. Roughly speaking, one can break a computational demanding job into independent parts 
which require little or no interaction with each other, then run each part on a seperately CPU.
